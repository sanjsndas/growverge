                    <p class="text-gray-600">To use our services, you must be at least 18 years old and have legal capacity to enter into contracts. By using our services, you represent that you meet these requirements. We may refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time. Certain services may have additional eligibility requirements, such as property ownership or authorization to make landscape decisions for a property. You are responsible for ensuring you have proper authorization for services performed on any property.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">Specific services will be governed by separate service agreements outlining scope of work, pricing, timeline, and other project-specific terms. These Terms apply to all service agreements unless specifically modified in writing. Conflicts between these Terms and service agreements will generally be resolved in favor of the service agreement terms. Service agreements may require deposits or prepayment as specified in the agreement. We may require signed agreements before commencing work.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">Service prices are quoted in proposals and service agreements. Prices are subject to change until a service agreement is executed. We accept various payment methods including credit cards, checks, and electronic transfers. Payment terms will be specified in service agreements, with balances typically due upon completion unless otherwise agreed. Late payments may incur interest at 1.5% per month or the maximum legal rate. You are responsible for all taxes associated with services unless we expressly agree otherwise.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">Cancellation terms vary by service type. For recurring services, we typically require at least 48 hours notice to cancel without penalty. Project cancellations may incur fees based on work completed and materials purchased. Special order materials are generally non-refundable. Cancellation requests must be made in writing. We reserve the right to cancel services for nonpayment, safety concerns, or breach of these Terms with appropriate notice unless immediate termination is required.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">Service appointments may be rescheduled with at least 24 hours notice at no charge. Repeated rescheduling or missed appointments may result in cancellation or additional fees. Inclement weather or other conditions beyond our control may require rescheduling with no penalty. We will make reasonable efforts to accommodate your preferred schedule but cannot guarantee specific dates or times. Rescheduled services are subject to availability.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">Refund eligibility depends on the service type and circumstances. Completed services are generally non-refundable. Prepaid services not yet performed may be refundable minus any non-refundable deposits. Materials purchased specifically for your project are typically non-refundable. Refund requests must be submitted in writing within 30 days of service. We will process approved refunds within 30 business days.

                    <p class="text-gray-600">You grant us reasonable access to perform agreed services at the specified property location. You must provide safe access to all service areas and disclose any hazards (underground utilities, pests, etc.). We may require easements or permissions for certain services. You are responsible for obtaining any required homeowner association approvals. We are not responsible for damage caused by pre-existing property conditions that were not disclosed to us before service began.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">You must notify us of any changes to your property that could affect our services (construction, utility work, landscape changes, etc.). We are not responsible for maintaining elements we didn't install without a maintenance agreement. Our work may require modifications to existing landscape features. We will discuss significant changes with you before implementation when possible. Changes requested after work begins may incur additional charges and delay completion.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">12. Plant Health and Survival</h2>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">We guarantee proper installation of plants according to horticultural best practices. However, plant survival depends on many factors beyond our control including weather, pests, disease, and maintenance. Limited warranties on plants may be available from growers. We may offer replacement plants at reduced cost within specified periods if proper care was followed. You are responsible for proper watering and maintenance after installation unless covered by a maintenance agreement.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">Maintenance services are tailored to your landscape's needs and may vary seasonally. Maintenance frequency is based on our professional assessment of your landscape's requirements. Services may include pruning, fertilization, pest control, irrigation checks, and cleanup. Specific services included in your maintenance plan will be detailed in your agreement. Additional services not covered by your agreement may be available for additional fees. We recommend annual re-evaluations of maintenance needs.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">14. Design Services</h2>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">Landscape designs are custom creations based on your property and preferences. Design fees cover creation of plans, not implementation unless specified. We retain intellectual property rights to designs but grant you rights to implement approved designs on your property. Design revisions may be limited by your agreement. Final designs represent our professional recommendations but may require adaptation during installation due to site conditions. We cannot guarantee exact replication of conceptual images.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="terms-point">
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">15. Installation Services</h2>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">Installation timelines are estimates subject to weather, material availability, and other factors. We will provide updates if significant delays occur. Project phases may need to be rescheduled due to conditions encountered during work. You must provide clear access to work areas and ensure pets are secured. Basic cleanup is included but some debris may require separate disposal services. Final walkthroughs should be completed before final payment to identify any touch-ups needed.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">16. Consultation Services</h2>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">Consultations provide professional advice but implementation is at your discretion. Recommendations are based on information you provide and our observations during the consultation. We cannot guarantee results from following our recommendations as many factors affect plant health and landscape outcomes. Consultation fees cover our time and expertise, not any follow-up services unless specified. More complex issues may require additional consultations or diagnostic services.</p>

Online plant recommendations and other services are based on general guidelines and may not account for specific site conditions. We encourage users to seek professional advice for complex landscaping needs. Access to online services may require account registration and compliance with our terms. We reserve the right to modify or discontinue online services at any time without notice.

                    <p class="text-gray-600">In the event of a dispute, you agree to first attempt to resolve the dispute informally by contacting us.

You waive any right to a jury trial or to participate in a class action. The arbitration shall take place in the state where Growverge operates, and the arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding.</p>
